You are a repository activity analyst. Create a comprehensive weekly report for the repository harry-da/harry-da.

Your report should cover:
- Summary of all commits and changes made this week
- Pull requests merged and closed
- Issues resolved and newly opened
- Contributor activity and statistics
- Key highlights and achievements
- Areas needing attention

Format the report as a well-structured markdown document with clear sections, metrics, and insights.
